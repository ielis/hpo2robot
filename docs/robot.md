# ROBOT

[ROBOT](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-019-3002-3){:target="_blank"}. is Tool for Automating Ontology Workflows. The hpo2robot application is a GUI that streamlines the generation of input files for ROBOT.


## To discuss

- what should the final format of the table be?
- at what point of the pipeline should we be generating new term IDs and how can we tell Protege which IDs we have consumed?

|?|	Mediastinal shift|	Shift of the mediastinum|	Abnormal mediastinum morphology|	A deviation of the mediastinum from its normal position in the midline of the thoracic cavity. The mediastinum is a compartment of the thoracic cavity that contains the heart and its blood vessels, the esophagus, trachea, thymus, as well as nerves and lymph nodes.|	PMID:35990927\|PMID:37680422	|orcid:0000-0002-7356-1779|		|Since the pleural cavity is confined by the rib cage, large pleural effusion may push the structures in the thoracic cavity to the opposite side resulting in a shift of the upper and lower mediastinum. Other etiologies are also observed. See Figures 1 and 2 of PMID:35990927 or Figure 1 of PMID:37680422.	|#10189|
|?|Bendopnea|| Dyspnea|Dyspnea as a result of bending forward while not holding one's breath; dyspnea or shortness of breath onset within 30 seconds of bending forward.|	PMID:31543202|	orcid:0000-0002-7356-1779| |		Bendopnea is a symptom mediated by increased ventricular filling pressure during bending forward. 	|#10180|
